Hello, I'm Soumitri - a photographer based in Singapore who focuses on photographing humans, food and products.
After studying Computer Engineering in the United States for several years, I moved back home in 2018 and
recently completed my diploma in Photography and Digital Imaging at the Chatsworth Medi@rt Academy.
Through an interest for film making, I bought my first DSLR in 2017. By chance, while taking street photographs,
it dawned on me that I really loved taking photos. Photography gave me the base to explore the vast field of the
visual arts. To incorporate compositional techniques, color theory and lighting into a single frame made me think
about photography differently. It was the right blend of creative freedom and technical challenge for me to pursue.
